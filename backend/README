I have created a database in the directory and there are four tables:

user: id, name, password, contact, rating, gender, title, subscribe.
(key, username, password-'md5'ed, contact info, average rating, gender, the index of titles that the user has, separated by spaces, whether the user is subscribed to the mailing list)
order: id, buyer, seller, eatery, location, time, price, rate, comment, complete.
(key, buyer id, seller id, the eatery id, the deliver location id-null if not delivering order, time (YYYY MM DD HH MM), price, rating, comment, whether the order is complete)
food: id, name, price, eatery.
(key, name, price, eatery)
location: id, name, eatery.
(key, name, whether it is an eatery)
food_location: food, location.
(food id, location id)

For you:
fill the database query class. methods: 
getUser(String email, String password) -> User();
putUser(User user) -> boolean success                             : true if success false if the user already exist;
deleteUser(String email, String password) -> boolean success      : true if deleted false if the password incorrect;

maybe some other stuff i dont know yet
